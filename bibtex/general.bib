  title = {ReActor: A notation for the specification of actor systems
	
	and its semantics},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {With the increasing use of the actor model in concurrent programming
	there
	
	is also an increased demand in precise design notations. Precise notations
	enable soft-
	
	ware engineers to rigorously specify and validate the non-deterministic
	behavior of
	
	concurrent systems. Traditional design notations are either imperative,
	too concrete,
	
	or do not support the actor model. In this paper, we present a new,
	TLA-inspired spec-
	
	ification language called ReActor that supports a declarative style
	of specification and
	
	selected programming language features in combination. For ReActor
	a precise opera-
	
	tional semantics is defined in terms of action interleavings. We propose
	ReActor to be
	
	used in abstract design specification and as a supplement to existing
	design notations,
	
	especially if a sound notion of concurrent objects is required.},
