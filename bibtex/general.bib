  title = {Actors: A Model Of Concurrent Computation In Distributed Systems},
  year = {1985},
  abstract = {A foundational model of concurrency is developed in this thesis. We
	examine issues in the design of parallel systems and show why the
	actor model is suitable for exploiting large-scale parallelism. Concurrency
	in actors is constrained only by the availability of hardware resources
	and by the logical dependence inherent in the computation. Unlike
	dataflow and functional programming, however, actors are dynamically
	reconfigurable and can model shared resources with changing local
	state. Concurrency is spawned in actors using asynchronous message-passing,
	pipelining, and the dynamic creation of actors. This thesis deals
	with some central issues in distributed computing. Specifically,
	problems of divergence and deadlock are addressed. For example, actors
	permit dynamic deadlock detection and removal. The problem of divergence
	is contained because independent transactions can execute concurrently
	and potentially infinite processes are nevertheless available for
	interaction.},

  title = {ReActor: A notation for the specification of actor systems
	
	and its semantics},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {With the increasing use of the actor model in concurrent programming
	there
	
	is also an increased demand in precise design notations. Precise notations
	enable soft-
	
	ware engineers to rigorously specify and validate the non-deterministic
	behavior of
	
	concurrent systems. Traditional design notations are either imperative,
	too concrete,
	
	or do not support the actor model. In this paper, we present a new,
	TLA-inspired spec-
	
	ification language called ReActor that supports a declarative style
	of specification and
	
	selected programming language features in combination. For ReActor
	a precise opera-
	
	tional semantics is defined in terms of action interleavings. We propose
	ReActor to be
	
	used in abstract design specification and as a supplement to existing
	design notations,
	
	especially if a sound notion of concurrent objects is required.},
