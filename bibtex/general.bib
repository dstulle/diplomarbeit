  Abstract                 = {A foundational model of concurrency is developed in this thesis. We examine issues in the design of parallel systems and show why the actor model is suitable for exploiting large-scale parallelism. Concurrency in actors is constrained only by the availability of hardware resources and by the logical dependence inherent in the computation. Unlike dataflow and functional programming, however, actors are dynamically reconfigurable and can model shared resources with changing local state. Concurrency is spawned in actors using asynchronous message-passing, pipelining, and the dynamic creation of actors. This thesis deals with some central issues in distributed computing. Specifically, problems of divergence and deadlock are addressed. For example, actors permit dynamic deadlock detection and removal. The problem of divergence is contained because independent transactions can execute concurrently and potentially infinite processes are nevertheless available for interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increasing use of the actor model in concurrent programming there is also an increased demand in precise design notations. Precise notations enable soft- ware engineers to rigorously specify and validate the non-deterministic behavior of concurrent systems. Traditional design notations are either imperative, too concrete, or do not support the actor model. In this paper, we present a new, TLA-inspired spec- ification language called ReActor that supports a declarative style of specification and selected programming language features in combination. For ReActor a precise opera- tional semantics is defined in terms of action interleavings. We propose ReActor to be used in abstract design specification and as a supplement to existing design notations, especially if a sound notion of concurrent objects is required.},
